I would like to thank Professor James Richard Forbes for his support over the last two years. His passion and extensive knowledge for his field of research makes him an ideal supervisor, and I was extremely fortunate to work with him during my Masters degree. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the other members of the DECAR group, current and former. In particular, I would like to thank Alex Walsh for always being available to discuss ideas and answer questions.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for their support, and for always pushing me to new heights.
