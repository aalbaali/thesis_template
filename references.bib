abstract = {In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based algorithm for real-time vision-aided inertial navigation. The primary contribution of this work is the derivation of a measurement model that is able to express the geometric constraints that arise when a static feature is observed from multiple camera poses. This measurement model does not require including the 3D feature position in the state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to linearization errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we propose has computational complexity only linear in the number of features, and is capable of high-precision pose estimation in large-scale real-world environments. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in extensive experimental results, involving a camera/IMU system localizing within an urban area.},

abstract = {A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.},

@article{Brossard2019,
abstract = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is both the historical algorithm for multi-sensor fusion and still state of the art in numerous industrial applications. However, it may prove inconsistent in the presence of unobservability under a group of transformations. In this paper, we first build an alternative EKF based on an alternative nonlinear state error. This EKF is intimately related to the theory of the invariant EKF. Then, under a simple compatibility assumption between the error and the transformation group, we prove that the linearized model of the alternative EKF automatically captures the unobservable directions, and many desirable properties of the linear case then directly follow. This provides a novel fundamental result in filtering theory. We apply the theory to multi-sensor fusion for navigation, when all the sensors are attached to the vehicle and do not have access to absolute information, as typically occurs in GPS-denied environments. In the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), Monte Carlo runs and comparisons to OC-EKF, robocentric EKF, and optimization-based smoothing algorithms (iSAM) illustrate the results. The proposed EKF is also proved to outperform standard EKF and to achieve comparable performance to iSAM on a publicly available real dataset for multi-robot SLAM.{\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\&}copy; 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {IEEE In this paper, we present a novel visual inertial navigation algorithm for low-cost and computationally constrained vehicle in GPS-denied environments by modeling the state space as the matrix Lie group, based on the recent theory of the invariant Kaman filter. The multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) is a well-known visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm that performs the fusion of the visual and inertial information by constraining each other through the stochastically cloned pose within a sliding window. However, conventional MSCKF suffers from the inconsistent state estimates caused by the spurious gain along the unobservable directions, resulting in large estimation errors. To tackle this problem, we extend the concepts of the state and noise of the MSCKF from Euclidean space to matrix Lie group. We model the state of the MSCKF as the element of the specially customized matrix Lie group and use the noise uncertainty modeling with the corresponding Lie algebra. The detailed derivation and observability analysis of proposed filter are provided to prove that the proposed filter is more consistent than the conventional MSCKF. The proposed MSCKF on matrix Lie group (MSCKF-LG) naturally enforces the state vector to exist in the state space that maintains the unobservability characteristics without any artificial remedies. The performance of the proposed filter is validated through the Monte-Carlo simulation and the real-world experimental dataset.},

abstract = {The marijuana cannabinoid, dg-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suppresses immunity to Legionella pneumophila and development of Th1 activity and cell-mediated immunity. In the current study, THC effects on cytokines regulating the development of Th1 cells were examined. BALB/c mice showed significant increases in serum IL-12 and IFN-gamma within hours of infection; however, the levels of these Th1-promoting cytokines as well as resistance to a challenge infection were suppressed by THC (8 mg/kg) injected 18 h before priming, The Th2-promoting cytokine, IL-4, was increased within hours of a Legionella infection and was further increased by THC treatment. These results suggested that THC injection suppressed the cytokine environment promoting Th1 immunity. In additional experiments, THC pretreatment and infection of IL-4 knockout mice showed that serum IL-12 and IFN-gamma were suppressed equally in both knockout and normal mice. This suggested that the drug-induced increase in IL-4 was not responsible for the decreases in serum IL-12 and IFN-gamma. However, THC treatment was shown to suppress the expression of IL-12 receptor beta 2 mRNA, indicating that, in addition to suppression of IL-12, THC injection suppressed the expression of IL-12 receptors, Finally, the role of cannabinoid receptors in Th1-promoting cytokine suppression was examined, and results with receptor antagonists showed that both cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 were involved. It is suggested that suppression of Th1 immunity to Legionella is not due to an increase in IL-4 production but to a decrease in IFN-gamma and IL-12, Furthermore, both types of cannabinoid receptors are involved.},

We argue they are the true generalization of linear systems of the form Xn+1=FnXn+Bnun in the context of state estimation, since 1—when G=RN the latter systems are recovered, 2—they are proved to possess the “preintegration” property, a characteristic property of linear systems that relates continuous time to discrete time, and has recently proved extremely useful in robotics applications, and 3—we can build observers that ensure the evolution between the true state and estimated state does not depend on the followed trajectory, a characteristic feature of Luenberger (and invariant)observers. The theory is applied to a 3D inertial navigation example. Interestingly, this example cannot be put in the form of an invariant system and the proposed generalization is required.},
